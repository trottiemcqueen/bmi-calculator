        <h5>What your BMI result <br> means</h5>
      
      
          A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' <br> Maintaining a 
          healthy weight may lower your chances of <br> experiencing health issues later on, 
          such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for <br> a nutritious diet with reduced 
          fat and sugar content, incorporating ample <br> fruits and vegetables. Additionally, 
          strive for regular physical activity, ideally <br> about 30 minutes daily for 
          five days a week.

    Limitations of BMI

    Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for 
    every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in 
    certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
    <hr>

      <ul>
        <li>
        Gender
        The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently, 
        a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.
        </li>
        <li>
        Age
        In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate 
        body fat content.
        </li>
        <li>
        Muscle
        BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't 
        differentiate muscle from fat.
        </li>
        <li>
        Pregnancy
        Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a 
        healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother 
        and child.
        </li>
        <li>
        Race
        Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at 
        lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your 
        GP or practice nurse.
